          <strong>Image Background: </strong>The image above is of Emerald Lake in
          Colorado which I took while visiting. I chose this image because the
          reflection on the lake was like a mirror which created an awesome looking
          picture, but it also represents me because I love the outdoors and
          adventuring. Some of my favorite hobbies include hiking, disc golfing,
          golfing, camping, or pretty much anything else that takes place outdoors.

          I'm currently a senior in my last semester of my undergraduate degree in
          <em>Computer Science</em>. I came to the U of M not knowing what I wanted
          to do, and decided to try out a python course which I absolutely loved,
          and that got me hooked on the major.

          I have no formal education regarding web programming. The little bit that
          I do know comes from my internship experience I had this past summer where
          I used ReactJS for project work. I'm very excited for this class because
          what I did over the summer has peaked my interest in web development.
